My O
only O
disappointment O
with O

that O
they O

without O
an O
i5 O

however O
the O
trade-off O
is O
that O
you O
achieve O
a O
longer O

life I-aspect
of O
about O
2 O

I O
took O
it O

remove O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
MacBooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O

so O
you O

the O

I O

The O
reason O
why O
I O
did O

that O

commit O
all O

the O

superior O

the O

I O
imagine O
if O
I O
left O
my O
player O
untouched O
( O
no O

it O
could O
play O
for O

more O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
features O
about O
the O
player O
is O
its O
ability O
to O
sync B-aspect
to I-aspect
windows I-aspect

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

With O
the O
latest O
version O
( O

, O
I O
can O
simply O
browse O
my O
WMP O
library O
, O
adding O
songs/albums/artists O
to O
the O

list O

and O
then O
sync O
all O
of O
the O
tracks O
at O
any O
time O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Its O
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
included O
Creative O
software O
, O
but O
much O
less O
invasive O
, O
and O
overall O
better O
looking O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

With O
WMP10 O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
install O
any O
software O
other O
than O
the O
driver O
, O
which O
makes O
using O
multiple O
computers O
fairly O
simple O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
touchpad B-aspect
is O
great O
once O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
, O
and O
I O
much O
prefer O
it O
to O
standard O
buttons O
or O
scroll O
wheels O
( O
as O
on O
the O
Dell O
DJ O
for O
example O
) O

They O
are O
sensitive O
and O
accurate O
( O
perhaps O
too O
accurate O
, O
it O
senses O
through O
t-shirt O
cloth O
, O
but O
the O
touchpad B-aspect
can O
be O
locked O
) O
, O
but O
easy O
to O
clean O
, O
unlike O
buttons O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Also O
, O
the O
touchpad B-aspect
seems O
to O
be O
waterproof O

The O
FM O
radio O

is O

spectacular O

it O
will O
pick O

most O
powerful O

any O

metro O
area O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Its O
ability O
to O
record O

is O
useful O
as O
well O

the O

which O
is O
why O
it O
amazes O

how O
many O

it O

that O
this O

maybe O
it O

Another O
thing O
I O
do O

is O
that O
some O
of O
the O

take O
1-2 O

will O

took O
it O
everywhere O

even O
at O

So O
, O
I O
was O
one O
who O
was O
ready O

Then O
last O

my O

just O
quit O

period O

After O
consulting O
with O
Creative O

customer O
support O

they O
determined O
that O
the O
hard O

was O
broken O
and O
the O
only O
recourse O
was O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repair O

which O
would O
cost O
me O

it O

They O
said O
the O
repair O
could O
take O

being O
impatient O

I O
decided O
to O
just O
order O
another O
one O

1 O

then O
I O
could O
have O

here O

normally O
expect O
a O

better O

from O
Creative O

so O
maybe O
they O
will O
do O
better O
with O
the O
next O

The O

! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
purchased O
this O
over O
the O
Ipod O

because O
it O
had O
several O
nice O
features B-aspect
: O
extra O
1G O
storage O
, O
WMA O
support O
, O
replaceable O
battery O
, O
and O
especially O
that O
it O
was O

an O

with O
their O
proprietary O
architecture O

it O

I O

I O
had O

the O

The O
touchpad B-aspect

virtually O
unusable O

sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
press O

mad O
to O
make O
a O

other O

the O

brush O
causes O
something O

be O
selected O
that O
you O
do O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
is O
by O

my O
biggest O
complaint O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Another O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
latest O
2.0 O
firmware O
upgrade O
moves O
you O
into O
Windows O
Media O
Player O

which O
seems O
to O
be O
very O
, O
very O
slow O
for O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Also O
note O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
charge O
when O
connected O
to O
the O
PC O
, O
only O
when O
plugged O
into O
an O
AC O
socket O
even O
though O
they O
both O
connect O
to O
the O
single O
USB O
port O
on O
the O
player O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
charge O
the O
battery O
separately O
from O
downloading O
music O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

... O
then O
this O
might O
intrigue O
you O
greatly O

The O
hook O
with O
this O
MP3 O
player O

is O
clearly O
going O
to O
be O
the O

Finally O
, O
someone O
has O
figured O
out O
that O

help O
it O

, O
I O

First O
off O

the O
battery B-aspect

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
camera O
uses O
a O
lithium O
battery B-aspect
, O
I O
find O
lithium O
batteries O
to O
be O
highly O
inconvenient O
; O
because O
what O
if O
you O
are O
on O
vacation O
, O
where O
the O
nearest O
place O
to O
buy O
batteries O
is O
just O
a O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
inconvenient O
, O
but O
also O
the O
battery B-aspect
life O

short O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
longest O
I O
've O
had O
it O
work O
was O
about O
1 O
hour O

45 O
minutes O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
is O
n't O
uncommon O
in O

though O
, O
just O
as O
long O
as O
you O
bring O
your O

you O
should O
be O
fine O

Another O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
camera O
was O
the O
zoom B-aspect
function O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Such O
a O
small O
zoom O

that O
you O
would O
think O
that O
the O

would O
be O
silent O
since O
it O
hardly O
zooms B-aspect

wrong O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Very O
wrong O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
zoom B-aspect
function O
on O
this O
camera O
is O
so O
loud O
that O
sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
unable O
to O
use O
it O
if O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
you O
must O
be O
quiet O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Even O
just O
turning O
the O
camera O
on O
will O
move O
the O
lens O
a O
little O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
noisy O
start-up O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
flash B-aspect
is O
very O
weak O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Really O
dissapointing O

you O

farther O
away O
then O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
last O
problem O
I O
found O
with O
this O
camera O
was O
the O
macro B-aspect
function O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
auto-focus O
on O
the O
camera O
seems O
to O
have O
trouble O
focusing O
on O
the O
subject O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

To O
make O
matters O
work B-aspect

there O
is O
no O

this O
problem O

you O
are O
not O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

These O
are O
all O
the O
flaws O
I O
found O
in O
the O
camera O

it O

not O
my O
first O
choice O

I O
have O
come O
across O
many O
other O
beginner O

I O
prefer O

this O
camera O

the O
thing O
you O
have O
to O
keep O

about O
this O

is O
the O
size B-aspect

I O
EVER O

is O
so O
light B-aspect

tiny B-aspect
that O
I O
literally O
carry O
it O
everywhere O

which O
is O

I O

My O
only O
complaint O
and O
the O
reason O
I O

that O
the O

The O
camera O
is O
as O
easy O
to O
use B-aspect
as O
a O
point O
and O
shoot O
, O
and O
with O
instant O
review O
on O
the O
LCD O
screen O
, O
you O
can O
retake O
any O
flubbed O
shots O

The O
two-times O
optical B-aspect
zoom I-aspect
operates O
smoothly O

quietly O

and O
lo O

behold O
, O
a O
two-piece O
shutter-like O

automatically O
slides O
closed O

the O

when O
you O
turn O
the O
camera O
off O

I O
also O
had O
no O
problems O
installing O
or O
running O
the O
camera O
software B-aspect
on O
my O
PC O

I O
'm O
still O
learning O
about O
file O
sizes O
( O
and O
how O
large O
is O
too O
large O
to O
email O

, O
and O
I O
did O
erase O
one O

I O
wanted O
to O
keep O
as O
I O
was O
getting O
used O

the O

But O
otherwise O
I O
am O
thrilled O
to O
have O
taken O
the O
plunge O
into O
digital O
photography O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

And O
there O
are O
two O
more O
advantages O
to O
digital O
photography O
which O
I O
had O
n't O
anticipated O
, O
beyond O
the O
lack O
of O
film O
and O
developing O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

One O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
censorship O
of O
your O
photos O
-- O
time O
for O
some O
, O
uh O
, O
fashion O
photography O
of O
your O
wife O
or O
girlfriend O
, O
if O
that O
's O
something O
you O
both O
would O
enjoy O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Another O
is O
the O
ability O
to O
upload O
images O
from O
your O
PC O
to O
a O
memory O
card O
in O
the O
camera O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
is O
a O
great O
source O
of O
personal O
entertainment O
for O
travelers O
, O
if O
you O
catch O
my O
drift O
, O
and O
you O
can O
zoom O
in O
on O
the O
LCD O
images O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
would O
also O
recommend O
Canon O
's O
soft O
case O
for O
the O
camera O
, O
which O
has O
a O
slot O
to O
attach O
to O
your O
belt O
along O
with O
a O
second O
nicely O
finished O
compartment O
to O
hold O
an O
extra O
battery O
or O
memory O
card O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

As O
other O
reviews O
have O
noted O
, O
you O
will O
definitely O
want O
one O
or O
more O
additional O
memory O
cards O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
've O
found O
I O
can O
get O

At O
any O
rate O
, O
if O
you O
have O
been O
interested O
in O
digital O
photography O
but O
the O
price O
and O
confusion O
have O
held O
you O
back O
, O
consider O
the O
Canon O

Digital O
Elph O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

It O
really O
is O
the O
perfect O
travel O

plus O
it O
offers O
the O

What O

can O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
was O

rugged B-aspect

I O

camera O

is O
easy O

I O
wanted O
standard O

expansion I-aspect
( O
CF O

, O
macro B-aspect

, O
and O
if O
possible O
, O
a O
waterproof O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
is O
the O
only O
camera O
with O
all O
these O
capabilities O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Even O
with O
the O
waterproof O
housing O
it O
is O
small B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
lens B-aspect
retracts O
and O
has O
its O
own O
metal O
cover O
so O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
fuss O
with O
a O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
metal O

seems O
very O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Turn-on O

I O

the O

if O
there O
were O
true O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

For O
example O
, O
in O
auto B-aspect

you O
ca O
n't O
use O
the O

The O
auto B-aspect

not O
quite O

the O
Kodak O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
macro B-aspect
mode I-aspect
works O
well O
, O
although O
it O
takes O
some O
practice O
since O
the O
camera O
does O

And O
that O

a O

The O

I O
had O
a O
question O
about O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
of O
turning O
off O
the O
Norton O
firewall O
vs. O
the O
windows O
firewall O
, O
and O
waited O
45 O
minutes O
to O
speak O
with O
a O
tech O
support B-aspect
representative O
because O
I O
did O
not O
have O
a O
`` O
customer O

ID O
number O

'' O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Then O
when O
I O
went O
to O
Norton O

website O
to O
obtain O
a O

id I-aspect
number O
per O
the O

I O
had O

I O
could O
n't O

one O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

So O
I O
e-mailed O
the O
online O
tech O
support B-aspect
with O
that O
simple O
question O
, O
and O
got O
a O
reply O
which O
was O
totally O
unresponsive O
( O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
actually O
read O
the O

just O
sent O
back O
a O
few O
boilerplate O

. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

And O
, O
when O
you O
think O
about O
it O
, O
it O
's O
insulting O
that O
Norton B-aspect
requires O
its O
customers O
to O
jump O
through O
these O
hoops O
-- O
anyone O
who O
can O
provide O
proof O

whether O
on O

( O
what O
if O
your O

, O
should O
have O
equal O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O

I O
am O
perfectly O

instructions O

Norton O
just O
makes O
life O

too O
hard O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Plus O
, O
when O
Norton O
provided O

there O
were O
so O
many O

( O
about O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
was O
totally O
baffled O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
originally O
had O
bought O
Norton O

for O
my O

after O
the O

finished O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
hardest O
part O
was O
the O
run O
around O
with O
what O
software O
suite O
to O
buy O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
package O
contains O
BOTH O
Norton O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
'd O
buy O
them O
separately O
in O
the O
combo O
package O
is O
for O
two O
liecenses O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

If O
you O
want O
integrated O
Antivirus O

this O
is O
what O
I O

suggest O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Norton O

memory B-aspect
usage I-aspect

systems O

It O
usually O
only O
takes O
5-10 O

I O
just O
got O
an O

it O
also O

on O

. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Both O
the O
antivirus O

firewall O
are O
integrated O
into O
one O
piece O
of O
software O
and O
they O
update B-aspect
together O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

You O
wo O
n't O
need O
to O
update B-aspect
your O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
best O
part O
of O
the O

is O
the O
visual B-aspect

About O
a O

an O

I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
the O

the O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
find O
the O
major O
problem O
with O

that O
if O
you O
have O
a O
very O
messy O
diaper O

ca O
n't O
tightly O
bundle O
it O
without O

the O
mess O
gets O
all O
over O
the O

that O
dumps O
the O
diaper O
and O
the O
stink O
is O
OUTSIDE O
of O
the O
diaper O
pail O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

My O
main O
complaints O
are O
that O
it O
should O
be O
deeper O

wider O

n't O
even O
fit B-aspect

smaller O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
hole B-aspect
to O
put O

have O
a O
3 O
month O
old O

they O
're O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
being O
too O
large O
to O
fit O
no O

how O
compact O
I O
make O

and O
how O
un-soiled O
they O
are O

I O

I O
suppose O
this O
is O
better O
than O

to O
have O

The O

all O

So O
, O
I O
lift O

find O
a O

A O
couple O
of O
tips O
to O
having O
a O
clean-smelling O

even O
with O
the O

: O
Double O

Get O
those O
diaper O
sacks O
you O
would O
use O
to O
dispose O
of O

if O
you O
're O
in O
a O
place O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
dump O
a O
dirty O

, O
like O
in O

Bag O
the O

this O
small O
clean-smelling O
bag O
and O
then O
chuck O
it O
in O
the O
Champ O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Another O
tip O
is O
to O
wash O
out O
the O
Champ O
frequently O
and O
spray O
the O
inside O
and O
lid O
with O
Lysol O
after O
every O
full O

I O
bought O
this O
diaper B-aspect
pail I-aspect
when O
my O
son O
was O
just O
a O
few O

I O
absolutely O
LOVE O
it O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
used O

work O

a O

It O
was O

The O
diaper O
champ O
could O
n't O
be O
easier O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

And O
the O
biggest O
plus O
is O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
buy O
any O
expensive O
refills B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

It O
takes O
regular O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
generally O
put O
kitchen O

bags O
in O
it O

you O
can O
use O
just O
about O
any O
size O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
pinch O

And O
it O
does O
an O
excellent O
job O

keeping O
the O

which O
the O

never O
did O

the O

If O

I O
can O
suggest O

since O
the O

once O

you O

As O

from O

I O

All O
I O
do O
is O
wipe O

maybe O
spray O
some O

let O

SIMPLE O
AND O
IT O
works B-aspect

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Also O
, O
for O
those O
that O
complain O
that O
the O
diaper B-aspect
champ I-aspect
is O
n't O
as O
effective O
as O
time O
passes O
, O
keep O
the O
following O
in O
mind O
: O
AS O
BABIES O
GET O
OLDER O
, O
THEIR O
DIETS O
CHANGES O
( O
aka O
SOLID O
FOODS O
! O
) O
AND O
SO O
DOES O
THE O
SMELL O
OF O
THEIR O
DIAPERS O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

In O
talking O
with O
other O
parents O
, O
I O
get O
the O
same O
feedback O
- O
as O
babies O
get O
older O
and O
become O
toddlers O
, O
ALL O
DIAPER O
PAILS O
become O
gradually O
less O
and O
less O
effective O
until O
they O
are O
just O
no O
longer O
useful O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Again O
, O
this O
is O
because O
as O
their O
diet O
changes O
, O
so O
does O
the O
consistency O
and O
odor O
of O
their O
stool O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
it O
gets O
stinkier O
! O
! O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
product B-aspect
is O
definitely O
one O
I O
would O
recommend O
and O
certainly O
worth O
the O
very O
reasonable O
price B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
love O
the O
diaper B-aspect
champ I-aspect
, O
it O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
use B-aspect
and O
since O
you O
can O
use B-aspect
regular O
garbage O
bags O
it O
does O
n't O
cost O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
for O
refills B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
only O
downside O
to O
this O
is O
that O
it O
can O
get O
pretty O
stinky O
long O
before O
the O
pail B-aspect
is O
full O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
wash O
ours O
out O
with O
lysol O
each O
time O
I O
empty O
it O
, O
and O
that O
helps O
, O
but O
when O
its O
hot O
out- O
well O
, O
just O
be O
prepared O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

We O
used O
this O
diaper O
pail O
from O
the O
day O
we O
brought O
our O
son O
home O
, O
until O
about O
13 O
months O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

That O
's O
when O
it O
went O
from O
Oderless O
, O
to O
oderous B-aspect
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Even O
when O
empty O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

So O
, O
I O
took O
it O
to O
the O
tub O
, O
scrub O
it O
down O
with O
disinfectant O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

It O
still O
smelled B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

So O
then O
I O
used O
straight O
bleach O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

That O
seemed O
to O
work O
-- O
for O
about O
3 O
days O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Then O
it O
started O
to O
smell B-aspect
whether O
there O
were O
diapers O
in O
it O
or O
not O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

However O
, O
for O
the O
previous O
13 O

is O
what O
I O
encountered O

PROS O
- O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Using O
your O
own O
bags B-aspect
is O
much O
cheaper O
and O
convenient O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
height B-aspect

a O
more O

others O

where O
you O
have O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Its O
stable B-aspect

so O
a O
curious O
toddler O
ca O

easily O
tip O

CONS O
- O
Difficult O
to O
open B-aspect
to O
change O
bag-twice O
my O
bags O
caught O
on O
a O
sharp O
edge O
inside O
and O
snagged O
as O
I O
was O
pulling O
out-leaving O
dirty O
diapers O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Also O
, O
diapers B-aspect
tend O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
causing O
the O
pail O
to O
get O
backed O
up O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

diapers B-aspect
can O
get O
stuck O
when O
turned O
around O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
tightly O
wrap O
them O
first O

way O
you O

very O

1 O

The O
Diaper O
Champ O
does O
n't O
require O
special O
refills B-aspect
that O
are O
expensive O
and O
hard O
to O
find O

We O

use O

show O
after O
watching O
the O
CMT O
people O
using O
it O

was O
impressed O
how O
it O
performed B-aspect

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Well O
, O
when O
I O
got O
it O
home O
and O
mounted O
it O
in O
my O

the O
shortcomings O
started O
showing O
up O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
adjustment B-aspect
knob O
seemed O
ok O

but O
when O
lowering O
the O

I O
have O
to O
practically O
pull O
it O
down O
while O
turning O
the O
knob O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
tried O
it O
with O

did O

any O
difference O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O

the O
1/4 O

is O
a O
pain O
to O
get O
in O
and O
even O
harder O
to O
get O
out O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Then O
the O
most O
disappointing O
was O
trying O
to O
use B-aspect
Viper O
raised O
panel O

that O
just O
barely O
fit O

I O

I O
did O

the O

3-1/4 O

router O
time O
and O
time O
again O
came O
up O

be O
the O
router O
of O
choice O

best O
for O
its O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
have O
a O
mid-size O

router O
already O
, O
( O
the O
DeWalt O
621-a O
fantastic O
router O
, O
read O
the O
MANY O
reviews O
) O
and O
needed O
a O
heavy O

machine O
for O
my O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
have O
a O
small O
fixed O

, O
single O

that O
I O
use O
freehand O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

But O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
some O
raised O
panel O
work O
and O
needed O
more O
power B-aspect
and O
variable O
speed B-aspect
to O
run O
the O
large-diameter O
bits O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

At O
first O
, O
I O
kicked O
myself O
for O
not O
buying O
one O
in O
the O
first O
place O
instead O
of O
my O
smaller O
router O
, O
but O
in O
retrospect O
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
best O
compromise O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
Hitachi O
has O
plenty O
of O
power B-aspect
, O
runs B-aspect
smooth O
, O
and O
cuts B-aspect
effortlessly O
through O
maple O
( O
with O
Freud O
bits O
! O
) O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

However O
, O
it O
is O
much O
bigger B-aspect
, O
bulkier O
, O
and O
heavier B-aspect
than O
my O
other O
router O
and O
I O
would O
not O
like O
to O
use B-aspect
it O
freehand O
( O
I O
keep O
it O
mounted O
in O
a O
table O
) O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Since O
I O
use O
it O
in O
a O
table O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
plunge B-aspect
feature O
, O
but O
if O
I O
ever O
need O
it O
I O
've O
got O
it O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
Hitachi O
is O
a O
great O
router O
for O
a O
great O
price B-aspect
, O
but O
only O
get O
it O
if O
you O
need O
the O
maximum O
power B-aspect
, O
variable O
speed B-aspect
and O
use B-aspect
it O
in O
a O

. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Otherwise O
, O
get O
a O
smaller O
single O
speed O
router O
, O
which O
will O
be O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-aspect
freehand O
and O
is O
all O
you O
need O
for O
smaller O
diameter O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
looked O
at O
this O
router O
and O
bought O
a O
Makita O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
Hitachi O
is O
made O
in O

looked B-aspect
cheap O

the O
Makita O
, O
which O
is O
made O

I O

you O
are O
right O

you O

I O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
was O
possible O
due O
to O

The O
only O
complaint O
I O

that O

The O

a O

I O
would O

The O
plunge B-aspect
action O
is O

smooth O

you O
make O
it O

This O

the O

this O

The O
only O
problem O
i O
find O
with O
it O
is O
that O
the O

attach O
the O
fine O

great O
in O
all O
circumstances O

The O
only O
beef O
that O
I O

of O
the O

I O
use O
it O

obviously O
I O
also O
used O
it O
for O
hand O

It O
it O
is O
a O

The O
only O
other O

the O

I O

say O
that O
I O

this O

First O

let O
me O
say O
that O
I O
got O
the O
20gb O
iPod B-aspect

I O
most O

would O
not O

So O
far O
, O
in O
the O
month O
that O
I O
have O
had O
it O

I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
in O
for O
service O
twice O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
is O
a O
hassle O
, O
of O

I O

not O

the O
problems O
are O
to O
blame O

poor O
construction O

, O
I O
do O
not O

the O

ten O

it O
can O
take O

The O

come O

for O
a O
MP3 O
player O
recently O
, O
and O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
play O
with O
my O
cousin O
's O
20GB O
iPod O
at O
some O
length O
to O
see O
how O
I O
liked O
it O
. O

I O
had O
initially O
been O
planning O
on O
buying O
this O
or O
another O
Apple O
product O

since O
decided O
to O
buy O
a O
player O
made O
by O
a O
different O
manufacturer O

Overall O
, O
I O
think O
the O
iPod O
is O
a O
good O
player O
, O
although O
I O
would O
note O
some O
features O
that O

LOOKS O

are O
fond O
of O

I O

not O

of O
them O

While O
I O
like O
the O
minimialism O
of O
the O
player O
, O
I O
try O
to O
avoid O
plastic O
products O
made O
of O
white- O
they O
tend O
to O
yellow O
with O
age O

While O
they O
have O
released O
those O
`` O
tattoos O

for O
the O
players O
, O
I O
think O
those O
just O
look O
cheap O
and O
gaudy O
, O
especially O
since O
they O
leave O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
iPod O
exposed O

The O
biggest O
red O
flag O
for O
me O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
although O
my O
cousin O

player O
was O
relatively O
new O

it O
was O
riddled O

While O
he O

not O
the O
most O

guy O
in O

, O
it O
was O
really O
beat O
up O
consider O
the O
minimal O
amount O
he O
uses O
the O
thing O
, O
and O
talking O
to O
other O
people O
who O
have O
iPods O
confirmed O
that O
the O
player O
scratches O
very O
easily- O
and O
from O
personal O
experience O
, O
they O
look O
terrible O

THE O
CLICKWHEEL O
: O
Again O
, O
I O
realize O
that O
most O

this O

the O
greatest O
thing O
since O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
strongly O
suggest O
anyone O
considering O
an O
iPod O
test O
it O
out O
first O
to O

how O
they O
like O
it O

I O
thought O
the O

As O
a O

I O
spend O
a O

am O
used O

Be O

you O
test O
this O

it O
does O
feel O
intuitive O
for O

IN O
SUMMARY O
: O
This O
is O
a O
good O
, O
basic O
player O
. O
It O
's O
not O
for O
everyone O
, O
and O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
try O
to O
put O
aside O
the O
huge O
popularity O
of O
the O
iPod O
and O
look O
harshly O
at O
the O
actual O
features O
that O
the O
other O
players O
on O
the O
market O
have O
, O
and O
see O
how O
they O
stack O
up O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Apple O
is O
already O
being O
outpaced O
by O
Creative O
Labs O
and O
Sony O
on O
the O
battery O
front O
, O
and O
just O
about O
any O
non-Apple O
player O
allows O
you O
more O
compatibility O
with O
download O
services O
than O
Apple O
's O
iTunes-only O
program O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

But O
since O
a O
lot O
of O
these O
MP3 O
players O
are O
marketed O
on O
aesthetics O
, O
do O
go O
to O
your O
local O
store O
or O
borrow O
a O
friend O
's O
and O
see O
how O
the O
product O
actually O
feels O
and O
works O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
may O
be O
the O
player O
for O
you O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
any O
other O
player O
, O
and O
others O
are O
ahead O
of O
it O
in O
certain O
areas O
, O
so O
practice O
some O
caution O
when O
you O
buy O
. O

Pure O
And O
Simple O
, O
Wonderful O
Stuff O

If O
, O
like O
me O
you O
simply O
want O
an O
iPod B-aspect
to O
play O
your O
mp3 O
's O
, O
buy O
this O
one O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

If O
you O
want O
colour O
screens O
, O
photos O
, O
videos O
etc O
, O
buy O
the O
latest O
( O
extremely O
expensive O
) O
model O
, O
I O
think O
the O
new O
60GB O
has O
all O
the O
extras O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
20GB O
just O
plays O
the O
songs O
, O
most O
people O
wo O
n't O
even O
use O
the O
20GB O
space O
, O
I O
've O
got O
about O
1500 O
songs O
on O
mine O
that O
adds O
up O
to O
nearly O
13GB O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
iPod O
over O
rival O
mp3 O
players O
such O
as O
the O
Creative O
Zen O
and O
the O
creatively O
named O
iRiver O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Most O
importantly O
because O
the O
iPods O
warranty O
is O
far O
superior O
to O
both O
these O
, O
the O
Creative O
Zens O
is O
only O
90 O
days O
, O
way O
too O
short O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
iRivers O
is O
also O
short O
, O
and O
lets O
face O
it O
, O
what O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
brake O
or O
go O
wrong O
, O
the O
Apple O
iPod O
or O
Creative O
Zen O
, O
iRiver O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Both O
from O
unspecialist O
makes O
, O
and O
in O
Creatives O
case O
a O
company O
that O
deals O
mostly O
in O
computer O
parts O
, O
and O
has O
not O
invested O
the O
money O
that O
Apple O
has O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

So O
reliability B-aspect
is O
the O
winner O
here O
for O
the O
iPod O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

As O
far O
as O
an O
actual O
player O
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
iPod O
is O
next O
to O
none O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
one O
advantage O
the O
iRiver O
has O
is O
it O
can O
play O
wma O
files O
aswell O
as O
mp3s O
, O
unlike O
the O
iPod O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

But O
all O
you O
need O
to O
do O
is O
convert O
the O
files O
( O
besides O
mp3s O
are O
larger O
and O
better O
quality O
files O
than O
wmas O
) O
using O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
convertors O
, O
my O
favourite O
is O
the O
dBPowerAmp O
Music O
Coverter O
which O
also O
allows O
you O
to O
burn O
directly O
from O
cd O
to O
hardrive O
in O
mp3 O
format O
unlike O
Media O
Player O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

It O
's O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
the O
mp3s O
do O
in O

sound O
better O

For O
looks B-aspect
, O
well O
iPod O
is O
head O

shoulders O
better O

both O
the O
iRiver O

Creative O

those O
snazzy O

other O

the O

the O

my O
third O

that O
occassionally O

seems O
to O
be O
a O
turnoff O
for O

the O

can O
tell O

three O

after O
all O
this O
frustration O
of O
adding O
all O

I O
asked O
the O

I O
spent O
over O

finally O

out O

they O
refused O

After O
over O

a O

finally O
agreed O
to O
fix O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
did O
a O

any O
basic O

All O
that O
had O
to O

was O
restore O

all O
that O
took O

Two O
days O
after O

I O
received O

if O
I O

I O
called O

The O
only O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Motorola O

well O
engineered O

have O
an O
user O

that O
reflects O
very O
poorly O
on O
what O

otherwise O
an O
excellent O
engineering O
company O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Its O
a O
real O

if O

The O
only O
downside O
I O
have O
found O
with O

that O
it O

my O

A O

I O

had O
their O

it O
has O
rarely O
given O

I O
upgraded O
from O
an O
older O
801.11b O
router O
to O
the O
Linksys O
WRT54G O
for O
its O
improved O
security B-aspect

and O
of O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

However O
, O
this O
product O
performed O
well O
below O
my O
expectation O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
Achilles O
heel O
of O
this O
router O
is O
its O
inability O
to O
stream B-aspect
music O
, O
or O
copy B-aspect
large I-aspect
files I-aspect
over O
the O
local O
network O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
use O
Apple O
iTunes O
to O
stream O
music O
to O
my O

via O
the O
Linksys O
router O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Although O
it O
will O
work O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
it O
will O
eventually O
hang O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

This O
behavior O
( O
hanging O
) O
also O
occurs O
when O
I O
transfer O
large O
files O
between O
my O
PCs O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

After O
some O
research O
on O
the O
Net O
, O
I O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
indeed O
a O
flaw O
with O
the O
current O
WRT54G O
design B-aspect
( O
WRT54G O
, O
version O

, O
which O
Amazon O
currently O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

If O
you O
just O
use O
the O
router O
to O
surf O
the O
web O
, O
this O
router O
should O
serve O
your O
needs O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

As O
I O
mentioned O
in O
my O
first O
paragraph O
, O
it O
supports O
WPA O
security B-aspect
, O
which O
is O
far O
superior O
to O
WEP O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

In O
addition O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
setup B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
w O
! O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

anted O
to O
rate O
the O
router O
higher O
than O
1 O
star O
, O
due O
to O
its O
security B-aspect
, O
easy O
of O
use B-aspect
, O
etc O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

However O
, O
since O
it O
is O
not O
being O
able O
to O
perform O
its O
core O
function O
adequately O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
deserve O
any O
higher O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
reader O
can O
find O
a O
better O
product O
with O
the O
competition O
and O
at O
a O
lower O
cost O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
got O
this O
inexpensive O
router O
to O
let O
me O
connect O
two O
desktops O
and O
a O
Thinkpad O
laptop O
to O
my O
NTL O
broadband O
modem O

instead O
of O
having O
to O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
rebooting O
the O
modem O
and O
connecting O
to O
a O
different O
PC O
, O
as O

when O
needed O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

So O
far O
it O
all O
works B-aspect
fine O
with O
either O
cable O

to O

Then O
, O
the O
hardest O
bit O
was O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
disable O
the O

the O
DHCP O

so O
that O
all O
computers O
would O
be O
in O
the O
same O

range O
and O
see O
each O
other O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Basically O
, O
I O
set O
up O
the O

) O
as O

to O

disabled O

gave O

the O
DHCP O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Also O
, O
I O
set O

and O
created O
a O
corresponding O

in O
my O

All O
this O
took O
a O

as O
I O

all O
this O

I O

the O

cnet O

steve O

a O
host O
of O

before O
i O
decided O
to O
buy O
this O

. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

All O
were O
generally O
favorable O
but O
i O
still O
had O
my O
doubts O
just O
because O
their O
review O
is O
based O
largely O
on O
the O
kind O
of O
photography O
that O
they O
do O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
now O
, O
after O
lot O
of O
shooting O
in O
many O
different O
situations O
, O
this O
camera B-aspect
is O
amazing O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
Was O
hesitant O
to O
rate O
it O
a O
10 O
just O
because O
it O
seems O
so O
extreme O
, O
however O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O
find O
anything O
wrong O
with O
it O

When O
I O

I O
thought O
that O

my O
number O

however O
picture O

aint O

nothin O
if O

So O
i O
figured O
i O
would O
`` O
compromise O

the O

i O
could O
, O
and O
would O
, O
take O

I O
like O
to O
take O
pictures B-aspect

would O
complain O
that O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
care O

it O

another O

the O
way O
that O
you O

pay O
the O

extra O
on O
the O

Once O
I O
learned O
how O
to O
use O
the O
diferent O
features O
, O
it O
is O
much O
easier O
than O
my O
old O
one O
to O
use O
and O
view O
pics O

And O
the O
video B-aspect
quality O
is O
amazing O
. O

On O
the O
60fps O
setting O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
regular O
video O
recorder O
! O

And O
it O
fits B-aspect
right O
in O
my O
pocket O
much O
easier O
than O
my O
old O
S30 O

I O
thought O
this O
camera B-aspect
was O
awful O
and O
I O
did O
tons O
of O
research O
on O
CNET O
and O
other O
sites O
. O

There O
were O
many O
times O
when O
I O
clicked O
the O
automatic B-aspect
shutter I-aspect
and O
nothing O
happens O

It O
seems O
you O
have O
to O
double O
click O
some O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
not O
all O
of O
the O
time O

Huh O
? O
I O
missed O
out O
on O
lots O
of O
photos O

lots O

lots O
came O
back O
blurry O

The O
controls B-aspect
are O
hard O
to O
manipulate O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
dark O

The O
lcd B-aspect
screen O
is O
too O
small O
since O
there O
are O
so O
many O
cameras O
that O
have O
larger O
ones O
