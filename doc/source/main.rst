NLP Architect by IntelÂ® AI Lab
###############################

| **Release:**  |version|
| **Last updated:**     |today|

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

NLP Architect is an open-source Python library for exploring the state-of-the-art deep learning topologies and techniques for natural language processing and natural
language understanding. It is intended to be a platform for future research and
collaboration.

The library includes our past and ongoing NLP research and development efforts as part of Intel AI Lab.

NLP Architect can be downloaded from Github: https://github.com/NervanaSystems/nlp-architect

Library Overview
================

Research driven NLP/NLU models
------------------------------
The library contains state-of-art and novel NLP and NLU models in a variety of topics:

- Dependency parsing
- Intent detection and Slot tagging model for Intent based applications
- Memory Networks for goal-oriented dialog
- Noun phrase embedding vectors model
- Noun phrase semantic segmentation
- Named Entity Recognition
- Word Chunking
- Reading comprehension
- Language modeling using Temporal Convolution Network
- Unsupervised Crosslingual Word Embedding
- Supervised sentiment analysis
- Sparse and quantized neural machine translation
- Relation Identification and cross document coreference

.. include:: _quick_install.rst

How can NLP Architect be used
=============================

- Train models using provided algorithms, reference datasets and configurations
- Train models using your own data
- Create new/extend models based on existing models or topologies
- Explore how deep learning models tackle various NLP tasks
- Experiment and optimize state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
- integrate modules and utilities from the library to solutions

Deep Learning frameworks
------------------------
Because of the current research nature of the library, several open source deep learning frameworks are used in this repository including:

- Tensorflow_ or `Intel-Optimized TensorFlow`_
- Dynet_

Overtime the list of models and frameworks included in this space will change, though all generally run with Python 3.5+

Using the Models
----------------
Each of the models includes a comprehensive description on algorithms, network topologies, reference dataset descriptions and loader, and evaluation results. Overtime the list of models included in this space will grow.

Contributing to the library
